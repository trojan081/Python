    "In the previous algorithms we used situation, when left index >= right index: <u>if l >= r: return -1</u>. So, the condition holds when l == r, and after that we return -1. It means that we start searching the key iff <u>r - l >= 0</u>, not > 1. And, for example, if we take the array of size 1, the condition will be <u>high - low == 1</u>, so the algorithm returns -1, although our number can exist in the array. Moreover, the algorithm will always return -1 for the key, which has 0 index.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) If we search deeper, we can find that it also has problems with keys, which are bigger than all the values of the array. Because of the problem of <u>low = mid</u>, where low assignes including mid, so the mid value will be checked again.\n",
